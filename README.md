# GoodPup
I made this iOS app as a fun way to "rate" dogs either good or bad. The app analyzes photos taken or selected from the library, and uses CoreML with the MobileNet ml model and an array of dog breeds to determine if the photo is a dog or not. If it is, it's a good dog, cause all dogs are good dogs. If it isn't a dog, the app will sold you (gently).

After you've successfully captured your good pup, you can save the photo with it's special badge to your photo library to share.
